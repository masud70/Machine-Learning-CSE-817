## Assignments

This folder contains the written assignments completed for the Machine Learning 817 course. 

**File Listing:**

* Currently, there are three assignments:
    * `19701070(Assignment_1).pdf` on the SVM algorithm.
    * `19701070(Assignment_2).pdf` on the Decision Tree algorithm.
    * `19701070(Assignment_3).pdf` on several ML and DL topics.

**Content:**

* These files contain your responses and solutions to various Machine Learning problems and concepts covered in the course.
    * **Assignment 1 (SVM):** You'll likely find in-depth discussions on Support Vector Machine classification, including its theoretical foundations, algorithm details, and applications. You might have also analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of SVM compared to other classification techniques. 
    * **Assignment 2 (Decision Tree - CART & ID3):** This assignment focused on Decision Tree learning, specifically exploring two important algorithms: **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)** and **Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)**. This assignment covers:
        * The decision tree building processes, splitting criteria (e.g., Gini impurity for CART, Information Gain for ID3), and how they handle continuous and categorical features.
        * Algorithms for both CART and ID3.
        * Mathematical examples of ID3.
    * **Assignment 3 (Several ML & DL Topics):** This assignment addresses a broader range of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts. The assignment have covered topics like:
        * Federated Learning
        * Incremental Learning
        * Transfer Learning
        * Generative Adversial Network (GAN)
        * Explainable AI
        * Transformer
        * BERT
        * AutoML
        * AI vs ML vs DL vs DS
        * TensorFlow vs PyTorch vs Keras
    Model architecture or required figures are drawn for each of these topics for better understanding.

## Lab#3: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Classification

This folder contains the code implementation for Lab#3 of the Machine Learning 817 course. Here, you'll delve into two popular classification algorithms:

* **Decision Tree:** This supervised learning technique builds a tree-like model where each internal node represents a feature (attribute) and each branch represents a decision based on the feature value. The algorithm iteratively splits the data based on features that best separate the classes. 
* **Naive Bayes:** This supervised learning technique is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes independence between features. It calculates the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class based on the individual feature probabilities.

## Content:

* **`decision_tree.ipynb`**: This Python script likely implements the decision tree model explored in the lab. It includes functions for:
    * Importing required libraries
    * Loading the training and testing data
    * Visualizing the training and testing data
    * Training the decision tree model.
    * Making predictions for new data points.
    * Evaluating the model performance.
* **`naive_bayes.ipynb`**: This Python script likely implements the Naive Bayes model explored in the lab. It includes functions for:
    * Importing required libraries
    * Loading the training and testing data
    * Visualizing the training and testing data
    * Training the Naive Bayes model.
    * Making predictions for new data points.
    * Evaluating the model performance.

**Data Files:**

* **`diabetics_data.csv`**: This is the only data files used in this lab for the both models implementation.

This lab allows you to explore two distinct approaches to classification and understand their strengths and weaknesses. Also provides an opportunity to compare and contrast between **Decision Tree** and **Naive Bayesian classification** algorithms.

# K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a robust and intuitive machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problems. By capitalizing on the concept of similarity, KNN predicts the label or value of a new data point by considering its K closest neighbours in the training dataset. In this article, we will learn about a supervised learning algorithm (KNN) or the k – Nearest Neighbours, highlighting it’s user-friendly nature.

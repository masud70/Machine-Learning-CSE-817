# Welcome to the Machine Learning (CSE-817)

This GitHub repository is my one-stop shop for conquering the world of Machine Learning (ML)! Here, you'll find the battle scars (well, code) from all the lab challenges and assignments I've faced throughout the epic Machine Learning 817 course, guided by the wisdom of Instructor Name: **Nasrin Sultana** from CSE CU.

**Let's Decipher the Code:**

* **Lab Folders (Lab#N):**  Think of these folders as my personal training grounds. Each one (named Lab#N) is dedicated to a specific lab assignment, where you'll find the Python scripts used to tame powerful ML algorithms like K-Means Clustering, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.  

  * Pro-tip:  These folders might also contain helper functions, data wrangling scripts, and any other secret weapons you used to conquer the labs.

* **Assignment Folder:** This folder holds the written assignments where I've showcased my theoretical understanding of various ML concepts. Think of them as my battle plans and strategies! 

**Important Notes:**

* Depending on the lab, data files might be stored within the `Lab#N` folders or in a separate data folder (if the data is reusable for multiple labs). 
* This README gives a high-level overview, but some labs might have specific instructions documented within their folders. 

So, grab your virtual sword (or keyboard), and feel free to explore the code within this repository. May the odds of becoming an ML master be ever in your favor!  

**A big thanks to Instructor Name: **[Nasrin Sultana](https://www.cu.ac.bd/public_profile/index.php?ein=5294)** for leading us through this exciting journey into the world of Machine Learning!**
